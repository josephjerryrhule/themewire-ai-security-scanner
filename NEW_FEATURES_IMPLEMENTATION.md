# New Features Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Clear Issues Functionality
- **Database Methods**: Added `clear_all_issues()` and `clear_scan_issues($scan_id)` to `class-database.php`
- **AJAX Handlers**: Added `ajax_clear_all_issues()` and `ajax_clear_scan_issues()` to `admin/class-admin.php`
- **JavaScript**: Created `themewire-security-additional.js` with `clearAllIssues()` and `clearScanIssues()` functions
- **UI Integration**: Added clear buttons to both scan page and issues page

### 2. Stop Scan Functionality
- **Scanner Method**: Added `stop_scan()` and `clear_scan_checkpoints()` to `class-scanner.php`
- **AJAX Handler**: Added `ajax_stop_scan()` to `admin/class-admin.php`

- **UI Integration**: Added "Stop Scan" button that appears during active scans

### 3. Enhanced File Validation (Ghost Files Prevention)
- **Improved File Discovery**: Enhanced `find_php_files()` method in `class-scanner.php`
- **Multiple Validation Layers**:
  - Directory existence and readability check
  - File existence and readability verification
  - Symlink and ghost file detection
  - File size validation to catch broken files

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### Existing Files Only Scanning
The enhanced `find_php_files()` method now includes:
```php
// Only process actual files with PHP extension that exist and are readable
if ($file->isFile() && 
    $file->getExtension() === 'php' && 
    file_exists($file->getPathname()) && 
    is_readable($file->getPathname())) {
    
    $filepath = $file->getPathname();
    
    // Additional verification - ensure it's not a broken symlink or ghost file
    if (is_file($filepath) && filesize($filepath) !== false) {
        $result[] = $filepath;
    }
}
```

### Stop Scan Features
- **Graceful Stop**: Cleanly stops scan and clears all checkpoint transients
- **Status Update**: Updates scan record with "stopped" status
- **UI Reset**: Properly resets buttons and progress indicators
- **User Confirmation**: Requires confirmation before stopping

### Clear Issues Features
- **Complete Clear**: Option to clear all issues and scan history
- **Scan-Specific Clear**: Option to clear issues from a specific scan only
- **UI Integration**: Buttons available on both scan and issues pages
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental data loss

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### To Stop a Running Scan:
1. Navigate to Security AI → Scan
2. Click "Stop Scan" button (visible during active scans)
3. Confirm in the dialog
4. Scan will stop gracefully and status will update

### To Clear All Issues:
1. Navigate to Security AI → Scan or Issues
2. Click "Clear All Issues" button (red button)
3. Confirm the action (cannot be undone)
4. All scan data and issues will be removed

### To Clear Specific Scan:
1. Navigate to Security AI → Issues
2. Click "Clear This Scan" button
3. Confirm the action
4. Only current scan's issues will be removed

## 🔍 Technical Implementation Details

### File Existence Validation
The scanner now performs comprehensive validation to ensure only existing files are processed:

1. **Directory Validation**: Checks if directory exists and is readable
2. **File Discovery**: Uses RecursiveDirectoryIterator with SKIP_DOTS
3. **File Validation**: Multiple checks per file:
   - `$file->isFile()` - Ensures it's a regular file
   - `$file->getExtension() === 'php'` - Only PHP files
   - `file_exists($file->getPathname())` - File actually exists
   - `is_readable($file->getPathname())` - File is readable
   - `is_file($filepath)` - Double-check it's a file
   - `filesize($filepath) !== false` - File has valid size

### Stop Scan Implementation
The stop scan functionality includes:

1. **Transient Cleanup**: Clears all scan-related transients
2. **Database Update**: Updates scan status to "stopped"
3. **Progress Reset**: Clears progress tracking variables
4. **UI Reset**: Restores buttons to initial state

This implementation ensures the WordPress site only scans files that actually exist and are accessible, eliminating false positives from deleted files, broken symlinks, or other file system anomalies.
